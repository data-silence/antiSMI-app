    This site is only part of the project, and serves as a testing demonstration of newsroom ideas.
    AntiSMI project is a research and still non-profit project at the intersection of ML and journalism that uses 
    machine learning models to analyse changes in the news flow in real time, trying to create a fundamentally 
    different way of consuming news in modern society.
    
    The project started with collecting and analysing information about partners of Yandex-news service as of the 
    beginning of last peaceful summer 2021. 
    
    Due to stupid events around here, it keeps growing and changing and I have no control over it anymore. I don't know 
    when or how it will end.
