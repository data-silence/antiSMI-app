This site is only part of the project, and serves as a testing demonstration of newsroom ideas.
AntiSMI project is a research and still non-profit project at the intersection of ML and journalism that uses 
machine learning models to analyse changes in the news flow in real time, trying to create a fundamentally 
different way of consuming news in modern society.

The project started with collecting and analysing information about partners of Yandex-news service as of the 
beginning of last peaceful summer 2021. 

Due to stupid events around here, it keeps growing and changing and I have no control over it anymore. I don't know 
when or how it will end.

If you have any questions, ideas or you would like to collaborate, do not hesitate to contact me:
